## What is Driven Evolution?

Driven evolution is a __deliberate, active way__ to change a qubit's state and avoid unwanted environmental noise.  

### How?

By applying a strong, _resonant_ microwave or laser pulse that __drives__ the qubit at exactly its natural frequency, the qubit can change to another state and avoid unwanted environmental noise.

### Rabi Oscillation

The driving field amplitude is fixed, but it changes with the noise for each different instance.

This ensemble of frequencies causes __decay__ in the resulting Rabi oscillation.


### Rotary Echo

Halfway through the driven evolution period, the driving field is reversed.


## Open Loop Error Suppression

These pulses or pulse sequences are __built into__ the gates used.  

They don't feed forward to apply certain pulses based on measurement inputs like error correction.

These open loop techniques reduce error rates due to coherent reversible errors.

# Week 3: Quantum Error Mitigation and Error Correction in Practice

Sunday, November 16, 2025

## Overview

Based on my preview of the quiz questions, this week's topics will focus on minimizing or correcting errors when qubits "move" from one state $\ket{0}$ to another $\ket{1}$ in the Bloch sphere.  The focus will be on superconducting qubits and trapped ion qubits.

Key topics include:

- energy level separation

- evolution

- stochastic noise

- qubit rotation

- pulses

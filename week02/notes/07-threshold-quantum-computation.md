# Threshold for Quantum Computation: Fault-Tolerant Quantum Procedures

Tuesday, November 11, 2025

Prof. Isaac Chuang, MIT

## Maximum Error Tolerance

What is the _maximum error_ that we can tolerate in our quantum gates and still build an arbitrarily sized, arbitrary low-error __quantum circuit__ out of noisy gates?

$P_{\text{th}} = \frac{1}{\# fault\ paths}$

where the fault paths are __universal gates__.

Need to compute on _encoded_ quantum data.

- Use stabilizer codes

- Gates are normalizer operations

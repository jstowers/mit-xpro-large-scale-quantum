# Principles of Fault Tolerance

## Threshold Probability

$ P_{th} = 1 / # fault paths

1. where the fault paths are in a __universal gate_ 

From classical Boolean algebra, any Boolean function can be constructed by a NAND gate

2. in a fault-tolerant procedure!


## Fault-Tolerant Procedure

A procedure is fault-tolerant:

1. If a single error occurs, it does not cascade into more errors as the calculation continues.

2. A fault causes at most __one error__ in each encoded block of bits.

# Fault-Tolerant Measurement

Wednesday, November 12, 2025

## Premise

In order to perform QEC, we have to _measure_ the stabilizers, $S$.

## How do we measure Stabilizers?

In looking at the generators, they have a lot of $Z's$ in them.

We need a fault-tolerant procedure to measure the _syndromes_ of the QEC code.

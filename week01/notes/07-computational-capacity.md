## Introduction

__Capacity__ comes from the communications field.

  • Claude Shannon (1940s)

  • A communication link exists between two parties, but the link is noisy.

  • What is the _maximum rate_ that two parties can communicate on a noisy channel?


## Computation with Noisy Gates

John von Neumann (1956) asked the same question, not about communication, but about computation.

What if we have gates plus noise?



By using __triple modular__ redundancy, you can start to increase the reliability of a system.

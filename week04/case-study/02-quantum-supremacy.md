## Goal of Quantum Supremacy

Can a quantum computer do something that a classical computer cannot do?

Assume that approximate counting is not equivalent to exact counting.

=> No classical simulation of quantum computing.


## Church-Turing Thesis

The __Church-Turing Thesis__ states that quantum computers can be simulated by classical computers with polynomial overhead.

To show quantum supremacy, scientists are looking for problems with significant complexity.  Problems with theoretic evidence that the _classical simulation_ of the model is hard.

The two leading proposals are:

1. boson sampling

1. random quantum circuits

## Boson Sampling

Scott Aaronson and Alex Arkhipov proposed Boson sampling.

# BPP and BQP

Sunday, November 23, 2025

## Definitions

__BPP__

    B - bounded error
    
    P - probabilistic (random)

    P - polynomial time

__BQP__

    B - bounded error
    
    Q - quantum
    
    P - polynomial time

## Deterministic vs. Probabilistic

If you do a deterministic computation, you always get the same answer.

If your computation is random or quantum, your answer will not always be the same.  But you'd like the correct answer _most_ of the time.
